## Medicines
* Diamox

* Dexamethasone (Brain) -> HACE -> High Altitude Cerebral Edema
  * The dosage is 4 mg every six hours. Avoid taking Dex as preventive medicine though.
  * Taper it down
* Nifedipine (Lungs) -> HAPE -> High Altitude Pulmonary Edema
  * 10mg first -> after 30 minutes -> 10mg
* Disprin
* Norflox
* ORS powder
* Digene

## Abbreviations

If you’re a more regular trekker or going on a tougher trail, a rain jacket and rain pants are far more comfortable. Yes, they’re a bigger investment, but they hold up better on longer walks.
Rain cover for day backpack
Waterproof socks
Waterproof gloves
Clogs like Crocs
Sun cap
