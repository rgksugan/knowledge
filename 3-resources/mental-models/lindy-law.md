# Lindy's Law

* It is a concept that describes how the future life expectancy of non-perishable things (like ideas, technologies, or cultural works) is proportional to their current age. Essentially, the longer something has been around, the longer it's likely to last in the future.

* It suggests that the past is a good indicator of the future when it comes to longevity.
