# The Simple Six
by [[Clinton Dobbins]]

## Highlights
> Never forget that consistency outperforms intensity.

> Walk whenever you can, as often as you can, and as far as you can.

> If you want a quick workout and would like to get your heart rate up a bit, then keep the rest short; 30-60 seconds max.

> Remember, consistency is the difference between failure and success in almost every aspect of life, but especially so when it comes to your health. So go out and find your passion, stick with it, and live your best life!

> Never forget that exercise should give you more than it takes away!

> Consistency is the difference between failure and success in almost every aspect of life, but especially so when it comes to your health. 

> Try to develop an 80/20 mindset. If you make the right choices and follow your routine 80% of the time, then the remaining 20% won’t hurt your results in the long run.

> To find your optimal foot placement, perform three vertical jumps as quickly as you can and note where your feet land after the third jump. This is your natural positioning and you should mimic this foot placement during your squats.

> The most famous of the hinge exercises is the deadlift. Simply put, a deadlift is when you reach down to grab a loaded barbell and then stand up straight to lift the weight from the ground to about waist high. The deadlift is a tremendous full body exercise. It works all the major muscle groups and engages more muscles than any other exercise (including the squat!). There's an argument to be made that if you could only do one exercise for the rest of your life then it should be the deadlift.

## Contents
The idea is to do six simple exercises consistantly. These exercises are

The program is to do 1 exercise as RF

| Exercise         | Normal Day                | RF Days                    |
|------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Goblet Squat     | 1 set of 10 reps          | 5 sets of 10 reps          |
| Kettlebell Swing | 1 set of 10 reps          | 5 sets of 10 reps          |
| Push up          | 1 set of 10 reps          | 5 set of 10 reps           |
| Kettlebell Press | 1 set of 10 reps each arm | 5 sets of 10 reps each arm |
| Chin-up          | 1 set                     | 5 sets                     |
| Walking          | 10000 steps               |                            |

Progression
* Time Under Tension(TUT)
* So how do we add TUT to an exercise? Let’s say that for the push-up you would usually complete a rep with a 1:1:1 tempo. That means you take one second to lower your body, one second to pause at the bottom, and one second to raise your body back to the starting position. If that seems too easy for you then slow it down to a 2:1:2 tempo, then 3:1:3, then 4:1:4, then… you get the idea.
* 5:1:5 on a RF day means time to increase weight except for Kettlebell swing.
  * For Kettlebell swing, increase one rep per week. After 20 rep, increse weight

* Pick two kettlebells to start with one lighter and one heavy.
  * Lighter for kettlebell press
  * Heavier for kettlebell swing and goblet squat
