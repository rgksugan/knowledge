# The Art of Spending Money
by [[Morgan Housel]]

## Highlights
> Drugs may be a recreational pastime for the rich, but for the poor they are often a gateway to further pain.

> Becoming famous is amazing. Being famous is a mixed bag. Losing fame is miserable.

> Not needing wealth is more valuable than wealth itself.

> She had little, but wanted even less.

> The best use of money is as a tool to leverage who you are, but never to define who you are.

> Everyone driving slower than you is an idiot, and everyone driving faster than you is a maniac!

> All happiness in life is just the gap between expectations and circumstances.

> There is no amount of success that can’t be destroyed by the temptation to grab too much of it.

> No amount of money can compensate for a lack of character, honesty, and genuine empathy toward others.

> A noble goal as a parent should not be to raise successful children—success should be an offshoot of raising children who feel confident enough to find success on their own.

> The more susceptible you are to advertising, the less satisfied you are with your own life.

> Learning what to quickly say no to can be more important than what to buy.

> You should spend extravagantly on the things you love as long as you mercilessly cut the things you don’t.

> Reading becomes a chore if you insist on finishing every book you begin, because the majority of books are either adequately summarized in the introduction or just not for you.

> If you tell me your salary, and I can accurately guess how much you spend on cars, homes, clothes, and vacations, are you using money as a tool to leverage your unique personality, or are you just going along with what society says you should want to spend your money on?

> The strategy of having strong beliefs, weakly held, is often helpful.

> If you tell me what political party you belong to and I can instantly and accurately guess your views on immigration, abortion, taxes, and guns, are you really thinking independently, or just going along with your tribe?

> Religion and politics are contentious because almost by definition your beliefs are part of your identity—you’re not just dealing with ideas and philosophies, but tribes and belonging.

> MONEY IS LIKE gasoline during a road trip, You don’t want to run out of gas on your trip, but you’re not doing a tour of gas stations.

> The best position to be in is rich and anonymous.

> Wealth without independence is a unique form of poverty.

> THE PEOPLE I look up to the most are not necessarily the richest or most successful. Almost always, they’re the freest. The most in control of their own lives.

> If your friends’ idea of an awesome Friday night is skipping rocks into a lake while chatting about life, your material expectations stay more grounded.

> Good advice for a lot of things in life is to remember that you are a reflection of the three or four people you socialize with the most.

> Be careful who you socialize with.

> A study by three researchers once showed that if your neighbor wins the lottery, you are more likely to borrow money and go bankrupt in the future.

> A military genius is the man who can do the average thing when everyone else around him is losing his mind.

> If you want to know what lower-income groups will aspire to spend their money on in the future, look at what higher-income groups exclusively do today.

> The purpose of life is to experience things for which you will later experience nostalgia.

> Good memories are the closest thing to living for today while compounding for tomorrow.

> Good advice is never as simple as saying “Live for today” or “Save for the future.” The only good advice is “Minimize future regret.”

> Taking too little risk is like smoking cigarettes, taking too much risk is like doing heroin. Both will harm you, the only difference is how quickly.

> You need to accurately understand how you’ll feel about your current decisions at various points in the future.

> The pleasure you get from utility can be more durable than pleasure gained from status.

> As a writer, I’ve always believed in what I call “selfish writing.” I write for an audience of one—me. I write stories I find interesting about topics I find useful, without wondering if readers feel the same. Not only is it more enjoyable, but I think it produces better work: The common writing phrase “know your audience” can quickly turn into “shamelessly pander to your audience” in a way that ruins a lot of writing.

> Buying things for their utility gives you the ability to express your own identity, while chasing status often makes you conform to others’ identity.

> There’s this idea in relationships that you can’t be happy with a partner if you can’t be happy without them.

> Would you rather be known as the best investor in the world but in reality be the worst, or be thought of as the world’s worst investor when you were actually the best?

> The big question about how people behave is whether they’ve got an Inner Scorecard or an Outer Scorecard.

> Looking back, whether you lived a good life will likely have little to do with how much money you made or spent.

> Everyone is jealous of what you’ve got, no one is jealous of how you got it.

> Becoming famous is amazing. Being famous is a mixed bag. Losing fame is miserable.

> She had little, but wanted even less.

> Don’t let anyone tell you what you should or shouldn’t spend money on. There is no “right” way.

> Drugs may be a recreational pastime for the rich, but for the poor they are often a gateway to further pain.

> People are not rational. They are rationalizing. Once you understand this simple fact, all the oddest human behavior will suddenly make way more sense.

> I have noticed that those most capable of delayed gratification are often those who enjoy their work. The pay might be good, but the urge to compensate for your hard work with heavy spending isn’t there.

> Everyone is a product of their own unique past.

> Never make fun of how someone spends their money, because they learned it from living.

> Never make fun of someone for mispronouncing a word, because it means they learned it from reading.

> Dawson wrote that his goal was not to make a living; it was to make a life, and only a fool would sacrifice his actual life for the endless pursuit of an imaginarily better one.

> Many a man thinks he is buying pleasure, when he is really selling himself a slave to it.

> It’s astounding to witness someone gain what they thought they always wanted only to realize that happiness is more complicated than they first assumed.

> There’s an old saying that nothing’s worse than getting what you want but not what you need.

> Spending money to show people how much money you have is a fast way to go broke and an expensive way to gain respect.

> Carl Jung, one of the most influential psychologists to ever live, was once asked, “What do you consider to be more or less basic factors making for happiness in the human mind?” Jung listed them off: 1. Good physical and mental health. 2. Good personal and intimate relationships, such as those of marriage, the family, and friendships. 3. The faculty for perceiving beauty in art and nature. 4. Reasonable standards of living and satisfactory work. 5. A philosophic or religious point of view capable of coping successfully with the vicissitudes of life.
