# Learn to Earn
by [[Peter Lynch]]

## Highlights
> A person who owns property and has a stake in the enterprise is likely to work harder and feel happier and do a better job than a person who doesn’t.

> Whenever crowds of people bet their life savings on a hopeless proposition, it’s called a “mania” or a “bubble.” The pattern is always the same. Frantic investors pay ridiculous prices in order to get in on a spurious opportunity, and sooner or later, the prices come crashing down.

> The new hot item was railroad stocks and bonds. At one point, people were buying anything with the name “rail” in it, and not caring what prices they paid.

> Among the causes of slavery, primitive agriculture was a major culprit.

> Another factor that may have contributed to the national prosperity is that our borders were effectively closed to many foreign-made goods by prohibitive tariffs. These days, we hear a lot about free trade and what a good thing it is, but during the heyday of the U.S. economy, when we had our fastest growth and our factories were running at full speed, foreign competitors had trouble entering our markets and our industries were somewhat protected from overseas competition.

> His book Das Kapital became the Bible of communists everywhere, and outside the Bible, one could argue it was the most influential book ever written.

> Certain kinds of companies can ride out depressions and recessions and other periods when money is scarce. These are called consumer growth companies. They sell inexpensive items: beer, soft drinks, snacks, and so forth, or necessities, such as medicines that people can’t live without. Chewing gum and candy companies, such as Wrigley’s, can thrive on recessions, because as Mr. Wrigley himself once said: “The sadder they are, the more the people chew.”

> Housewives preferred the vacuum cleaner to the simplicity of the broom, and the washing machine to the simplicity of the churn tub, and the processed foods to slaving over a hot stove.

> On the road, families looked forward to staying in the chain motel and eating at the chain restaurant, because there they knew what they were getting.

> A lot of smart investors have learned to take advantage of this. They realize that capital (money) is as important to their future as their own jobs (labor).

> In other words, to a credit-card company, you’re a better investment than a stock.

> It’s OK to pay interest on a house or an apartment, which will increase in value, but not on cars, appliances, clothes, or TV sets, which are worth less and less as you use them.

> It’s not always brainpower that separates good investors from bad; often, it’s discipline.

> Buy shares in solid companies with earning power and don’t let go of them without a good reason. The stock price going down is not a good reason.

> They divide into teams, and each team has to decide which stocks to buy with its mythical bankroll. The game takes about ten weeks from start to finish. Results are tallied, and the team whose stocks have gone up the most at the end of the period wins the game. The winning teams in each school compete with the winners from other schools in local, county, and regional or state competitions.

> People never lose money on stocks they don’t own.

> Earnings, sales, debt, dividends, the price of the stock: These are some of the key numbers stockpickers must follow.

> If you’re in New York sometime and you’ve got nothing better to do, the NYSE is worth a visit.

> Warhol was only joking, but every stock trade of fifty shares or more gets its five seconds of international fame.

> If you take a large group of companies, add their stock prices together, and divide by their earnings, you get an average p/e ratio. On Wall Street they do this with the Dow Jones Industrials, the S&P 500 stocks, and other such indexes. The result is known as the “market multiple” or “what the market is selling for.”

> The market multiple is a useful thing to be aware of, because it tells you how much investors are willing to pay for earnings at any given time. The market multiple goes up and down, but it tends to stay within the boundaries of 10 and 20. The stock market in mid-1995 had an average p/e ratio of about 16, which meant that stocks in general weren’t cheap, but they weren’t outrageously expensive, either.

> A company has two important birthdays—the day it incorporates and the day it goes public.

> On Wall Street, the warning labels are called “red herrings.”

> Only in the capitalist system can backyard inventors and school dropouts start companies that employ thousands of people and pay taxes and make the world a better place to live. The citizens of communist countries never had that chance.

> There’s no better time for teenagers and recent college grads to enter the workforce than in the middle of a hot economy.

> You can see that they last an average of eleven months, and cause an average of 1.62 million people to lose their jobs.

> They can lose millions, or even billions, of dollars, and unless they have enough money in the bank to tide them over, they face the prospect of going bankrupt.

> When stock prices fall 10 percent from their most recent peak, it’s called a “correction.” We’ve had fifty-three corrections in this century, or one every two years, on average. When stock prices fall 25 percent or more, it’s called a “bear market.” Of the fifty-three corrections, fifteen have turned into bear markets. That’s one every six years, on average.

> America is still the land of opportunity where smart young people like Bill Gates of Microsoft can end up on the Forbes list ahead of the Rockefellers, Mellons, Gettys, and Carnegies.

> The higher up you are on the corporate ladder, the more likely it is that you will be paid in shares instead of cash. Executives are also given “options,” which enable them to buy more shares at a specific price.

> If picking stocks becomes your hobby, do yourself a favor and take an accounting course.
