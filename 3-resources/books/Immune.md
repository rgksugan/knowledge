# Immune
by [[Philipp Dettmer]]

## Highlights
> Proteins are the most fundamental organic building blocks and tools of all living things on this planet. They are so useful and manifold that a cell can use them for basically everything, from sending signals to constructing simple walls and structures to complex micromachines.

> But not only that, it also is able to remember everything about an enemy that showed up only once. It is the reason most diseases are only able to manifest themselves once in your life.

> In contrast to the Innate Immune System, your Adaptive Immune System is not ready yet when you are born. It needs to be trained and refined over many years. It starts as a blank slate and then gets progressively more powerful, only to get weaker again as you age. A weak Adaptive Immune System is one of the main reasons young and old humans are often much more likely to die from diseases than people in the middle of their lives.
