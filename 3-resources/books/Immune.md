# Immune
by [[Philipp Dettmer]]

## Highlights
> Proteins are the most fundamental organic building blocks and tools of all living things on this planet. They are so useful and manifold that a cell can use them for basically everything, from sending signals to constructing simple walls and structures to complex micromachines.

> But not only that, it also is able to remember everything about an enemy that showed up only once. It is the reason most diseases are only able to manifest themselves once in your life.

> In contrast to the Innate Immune System, your Adaptive Immune System is not ready yet when you are born. It needs to be trained and refined over many years. It starts as a blank slate and then gets progressively more powerful, only to get weaker again as you age. A weak Adaptive Immune System is one of the main reasons young and old humans are often much more likely to die from diseases than people in the middle of their lives.

> Any sort of invader that is able to give your immune system a run for its money is called a Pathogen—which appropriately means “the maker of suffering.” So every microorganism that causes disease is a pathogen, no matter what species, no matter how big or small. And almost everything can become a pathogen under the right circumstances. For example, a regular old bacteria living on your skin might not bother you at all, but can become a pathogen if you are going through chemotherapy and are immunocompromised, making it easy to invade you. So whenever you read “pathogen,” just remember it means “a thing that makes you sick.”

> Before the onset of antibiotics, even small wounds could lead to serious disease or even death.

> Even today with all the magic of modern medicine, bacterial infections are responsible for a good chunk of deaths each year.

> So next time when you hug your partner, know that their immune system is probably one of the reasons why you find them attractive!

> People who don’t have enough T Cells, because of a genetic defect, chemotherapy, or a disease like AIDS, have a very high chance of dying from infections and cancers. Sadly, even with the best our modern medicine has to offer, the lives of patients without T Cells often can’t be saved.

> Boosting the Immune System is a horrible idea that is used by people trying to make you buy useless stuff!

> On top of just eating right, the positive health effects of even moderate regular exercise have been known for a long time.

> Your body is made for movement and so moving it around a bit keeps a variety of systems in good health, especially your cardiovascular system. Working out also directly boosts your immune system, because it promotes good circulations of fluids throughout your body.

> So if you are still looking for ways to boost your immune system, an actual tangible thing you can start doing today is to try to eliminate stressors in your life and to take care of your mental health.

> Wash your hands at least every time you use the restroom, clean your apartment but don’t try to sterilize it, and clean the tools you use to prepare food properly. But let your kids play in the forest.

> Even in developed countries, a number of studies found that children who grow up in the countryside and especially on farms, surrounded by animals and with much more exposure to the outside, suffer significantly less from immune disorders.
