# The Basic Laws of Human Stupidity
by [[Carlo Cipolla]]

## Highlights
> Man is a social animal.

> It is my firm conviction, supported by years of observation and experimentation, that men are not equal, that some are stupid and others are not.

> A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly incurring losses.

> Class and caste were the social arrangements which favoured the steady supply of stupid people to positions of power in most societies of the pre-industrial world. Religion was another contributing factor.

> Essentially stupid people are dangerous and damaging because reasonable people find it difficult to imagine and understand unreasonable behaviour.

> A stupid creature will harass you for no reason, for no advantage, without any plan or scheme and at the most improbable times and places. You have no rational way of telling if and when and how and why the stupid creature attacks. When confronted with a stupid individual you are completely at his mercy.

> Against stupidity the very Gods fight in vain.

> The moral of the story is that each one of us has a current balance with everybody else. From action or inaction each one of us derives a gain or a loss and at the same time one causes a gain or a loss to someone else.

> The fact is that reasonable people have difficulty in conceiving and understanding unreasonable behaviour.

> The question that reasonable people often raise is how and why stupid people can reach positions of power and consequence.

> Within a democratic system, general elections are a most effective instrument to insure the steady maintenance of stupids among the powerful. One has to keep in mind that according to the Second Basic Law, the fraction of the voting population are stupid people and elections offer to all of them at once a magnificent opportunity to harm everybody else without gaining anything from their action. They do so by contributing to the maintenance of the stupid among those in power.

> An intelligent person may understand the logic of a bandit. The bandit’s actions follow a pattern of rationality: nasty rationality, if you like, but still rationality. The bandit wants a plus on his account. Since he is not intelligent enough to devise ways of obtaining the plus as well as providing you with a plus, he will produce his plus by causing a minus to appear on your account.

> Because the stupid person’s actions do not conform to the rules of rationality, it follows that: a) one is generally caught by surprise by the attack; b) even when one becomes aware of the attack, one cannot organise a rational defence, because the attack itself lacks any rational structure.

## Contents
### Law 1:
Always and inevitably everyone underestimates the number of stupid individuals in circulation.
### Law 2:
The probability that a certain person be stupid is independent of any other characteristic of that person.
### Law 3:
A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly incurring losses.
### Law 4:
Non-stupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid individuals. In particular non-stupid people constantly forget that at all times and places and under any circumstances to deal and/or associate with stupid people infallibly turns out to be a costly mistake.
### Law 5:
A stupid person is the most dangerous type of person.
