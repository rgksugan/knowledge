# The Basic Laws of Human Stupidity
by [[Carlo Cipolla]]

## Highlights
> Man is a social animal.

> It is my firm conviction, supported by years of observation and experimentation, that men are not equal, that some are stupid and others are not.

> A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly incurring losses.

> Class and caste were the social arrangements which favoured the steady supply of stupid people to positions of power in most societies of the pre-industrial world. Religion was another contributing factor.

> Essentially stupid people are dangerous and damaging because reasonable people find it difficult to imagine and understand unreasonable behaviour.

> A stupid creature will harass you for no reason, for no advantage, without any plan or scheme and at the most improbable times and places. You have no rational way of telling if and when and how and why the stupid creature attacks. When confronted with a stupid individual you are completely at his mercy.

> Against stupidity the very Gods fight in vain.
