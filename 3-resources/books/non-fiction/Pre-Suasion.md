# Pre-Suasion
by [[Robert B. Cialdini]]

## Highlights
> Anything that draws focused attention to itself can lead observers to overestimate its importance.

> Nothing in life is as important as you think it is while you are thinking about it.

> Thus, the persuader who artfully draws outsize attention to the most favorable feature of an offer becomes a successful pre-suader.

> Thus, to receive the benefits of focused attention, the key is to keep the focus unitary.

> Issues that gain attention also gain presumed importance.
