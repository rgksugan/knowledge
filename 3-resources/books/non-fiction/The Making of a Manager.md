# The Making of a Manager
by [[Julie Zhuo]]

## Highlights
> The ideal 1:1 leaves your report feeling that it was useful for her.

> I asked him how he evaluates the job of a manager. He smiled and said, “My framework is quite simple.” Half of what he looked at was my team’s results—did we achieve our aspirations in creating valuable, easy-to-use, and well-crafted design work? The other half was based on the strength and satisfaction of my team—did I do a good job hiring and developing individuals, and was my team happy and working well together? The first criterion looks at our team’s present outcomes; the second criterion asks whether we’re set up for great outcomes in the future.

> The first big part of your job as a manager is to ensure that your team knows what success looks like and cares about achieving it.

> Your role as a manager is not to do the work yourself, even if you are the best at it, because that will only take you so far. Your role is to improve the purpose, people, and process of your team to get as high a multiplier effect on your collective outcome as you can.

> Great managers are made, not born.

> The best outcomes come from inspiring people to action, not telling them what to do.

> In your first few months, your primary job is to listen, ask questions, and learn.

> What gets in the way of good work? There are only two possibilities.1 The first is that people don’t know how to do good work. The second is that they know how, but they aren’t motivated.

> “If you take nothing else away from today,” he told us, “remember this: managing is caring.”

> If you don’t believe in your heart of hearts that someone can succeed, it will be impossible for you to convey your strong belief in them.

> We are more than the output of our work on a particular team at a particular moment in time, and true respect reflects that.

> Your job as a manager isn’t to dole out advice or “save the day”—it’s to empower your report to find the answer herself.

> As a manager, your perspective on how your report is doing carries far more weight than his perspective on how you are doing.

> Call it what you want—fit, motivation, chemistry—but the things a person cares about must also be what the team (and company) cares about.

> There’s no cruelty like waiting and telling people late in their careers that they don’t belong.

> Your own boss should be one of your best sources of learning.

> When I started to see 1:1s with my manager as an opportunity for focused learning, I got so much more out of it.
