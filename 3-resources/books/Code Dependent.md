# Code Dependent
by [[Madhumita Murgia]]

## Highlights
> AI is a complex statistical software applied to finding patterns in large sets of real-world data.

> This lucrative business model that monetizes personal data is what American social psychologist and philosopher Shoshana Zuboff has called ‘surveillance capitalism’.

> Power concedes nothing without a demand.

> Conflict is the driver of social change.

> When . . . human beings are absent . . . I think technology comes a close second.

> Quantifying pain is a task racked with individual biases.

> In it they suggested they had little idea why the algorithmic system had chosen specific families over others; after all, machine-learning software was a so-called black box – opaque systems whose internal workings weren’t fully explainable even by their architects.

> Medicine is a science, but being a physician is an art. Practising medicine, it’s very human. It takes a high emotional IQ, a lot of heart to actually apply the science to be effective.

> When every single truth was known – fully and simultaneously to everyone, everywhere – the lie disappeared from society,’ he wrote. ‘The consequence was that society also disappeared.

> After all, the goal of digital work is to gain access to higher-paying markets and to be able to earn more money than what you would be able to earn locally.

> All revolutions are built on the backs of slaves. So if AI is the next industrial revolution, then those who are working in AI training and moderation, they are the slaves for this revolution.

> In particular, she points out, algorithm-training work, like teaching software to filter extreme social media content, was nothing new when you looked at the evolution of global capitalism. It was simply the next step along from Bangladeshi clothing factories, or flower farms in the Kenyan town of Naivasha, or even the cottonpicking estates in the United States. It’s just that the consequences of AI on people’s lives were being obscured by its shiny newness.

> Data workers are the invaluable human links in the global AI supply chain.

> Scalable systems like machine learning are built to benefit large groups, but tend to work well at the expense of some. The ‘some’ are usually individuals and communities that are already othered, floating in society’s blurry edges, fighting to be seen and heard.

> Move fast and break things.

> You’re fundamentally endowing machines to make decisions that previously were made only by humans. So, if we don’t do this well, we run the risk of creating more problems than before.

> Man toils like the silkworm which spends its life weaving, only to perish, confused, inside its woven creation.

> All conflict is ultimately caused by power, he told me. Tech companies that operate across borders with their billions of users hold immense power today, and have an outsized impact on the world, reminiscent of the ancient role of religions in society.
