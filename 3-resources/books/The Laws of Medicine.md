# The Laws of Medicine
by [[Siddhartha Mukherjee]]

## Highlights
* The only way to break the deadly monotony was to read.
* A doctors job was to make a diagnosis, make a prognosis, give support and care not to meddle.
* Science have laws - statements of truth based on repeated experimental observations that describe some universal or generalizable attributes of nature.
* Biology is the most lawless of the three basic sciences: there are a few rules to begin with, and even fewer rules that are universal.
* If you fail to use prior information, you will inevitably make foolish judgements about the future.
* There is no absolute knowledge; there is only conditional knowledge.
* History repeats itself - and so do statistical patterns. The past is the best guide to the future.
* Every science suffers from human biases.
* What better blame than self-blame?
* Doctors are men who prescribe medicines of which they know little, to cure diseases of which they know less, in human beings of whom they nothing.
