# The Laws of Medicine
by [[Siddhartha Mukherjee]]

## Highlights
> The only way to break the deadly monotony was to read.

> A doctors job was to make a diagnosis, make a prognosis, give support and care not to meddle.

>  Science have laws - statements of truth based on repeated experimental observations that describe some universal or generalizable attributes of nature.

> Biology is the most lawless of the three basic sciences: there are a few rules to begin with, and even fewer rules that are universal.

> If you fail to use prior information, you will inevitably make foolish judgements about the future.

> There is no absolute knowledge; there is only conditional knowledge.

> History repeats itself - and so do statistical patterns. The past is the best guide to the future.

> Every science suffers from human biases.

> What better blame than self-blame?

> Doctors are men who prescribe medicines of which they know little, to cure diseases of which they know less, in human beings of whom they nothing.
