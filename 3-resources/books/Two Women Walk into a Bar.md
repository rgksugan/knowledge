# Two Women Walk into a Bar
by [[Cheryl Strayed]]

## Highlights
> Two women can't live in the same house. It creates too much conflict.

> But there’s a spiritual component to dying. To some degree, people need to release whatever’s holding them here before they can make the transition.

> The distance I felt from Joan was at least partly due to my loyalty to Brian, my desire to defend him against the mother who claimed only to want his happiness but wished he would conform to her vision of who he should be—a reality that would make him unhappy.

> That I had not been with her at the moment of her death had torn me up for years, but eventually I came to understand some version of what Peggy was implying—that to die, my mother had to be alone. She wouldn’t let go if I or one of my siblings was in the room. We needed her too much. We held her here.

> Over the previous two decades, we’d come to love each other, but it was a particular, conditional sort of love, one based on circumstance and courtesy rather than connection and compatibility.

> There is no greater love than that between a mother and her child.
