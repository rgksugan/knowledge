# Tales From The Indian Jungle
by [[Kenneth Anderson]]

## Highlights
> The Indian villager is a man of unbounded patience, an attribute easier to understand if one observes his complete apathy, his capacity for resignation and for accepting whatever misfortune it may be the will of God to bestow upon him.

> To remain absolutely still is the first secret of successful concealment in the jungle.

> For it is the season when the jumlum-tree casts its purple fruit so prolifically over the ground, and this astringent delicacy is an article of diet absolutely irresistible to sloth bears, who will cover miles in a night to visit such a tree.

> As is their custom, they will begin to make for rising ground as soon as the false dawn breaks.

> It might not see us, for it is notoriously short-sighted. It is also very deaf. It might attack should we betray our presence, and we do not want to shoot it, for normally a bear does us no harm.

> To remain absolutely still is the first secret of successful concealment in the jungle. Even if an animal sees you, it will not be able to make you out provided you remain absolutely motionless. The second factor, of course, is the direction in which the wind is blowing. The sense of smell rather than of sight is far more developed in most wild creatures, particularly members of the deer family. Provided the wind is not blowing directly from you to the quarry, and provided you remain absolutely still, you have a good chance of ambushing practically any animal successfully.

> This natural inquisitiveness among the deer and antelope families is the reason why thousands of them are slaughtered each year by experienced poachers, who do just what I am doing at the moment, or adopt some other trick to entice them to their doom.

> The fawns have no such responsibilities and death will strike many of them down cruelly and suddenly, before the survivors learn that the great secret of continued existence in the jungle is to be ‘ever watchful at every moment; for death lurks everywhere.’

> The Indian villager is a man of unbounded patience, an attribute easier to understand if one observes his complete apathy, his capacity for resignation and for accepting whatever misfortune it may be the will of God to bestow upon him.

> There are no fixed rules in the jungle and no two animals are alike. Like us they are individuals; they react differently under different circumstances and the unexpected often occurs.

> It is remarkable how instinct enables a man-eater to differentiate between a possible victim, helpless and defenceless, and a would-be hunter capable of taking its life.

> Felines prey upon deer and such creatures as have a keen sense of smell. To do so upwind would render their stalk abortive, for the currents of air would betray their presence and their quarry would escape. Carnivores have therefore learned by instinct always to approach downwind, that is against the wind, so that their own scent will not give them away before they can attack.

> Unlike deer, the human being has practically no sense of smell so far as self-preservation is concerned,

> I dislike using dogs as bait. They are far too sensitive and suffer an agony of apprehension when chained up, as they appear to realize the danger they are in.

> The sunset hour and the corresponding break of day are the most delightful moments to be in a forest to anybody fascinated by the jungle and the wild creatures that inhabit it, for it is at these times that one hears the songs of the birds of the day at their best.

> India is a country that demands of its inhabitants a sharpness of wit.

> The stave thudded down across the panther’s back and the panther leapt upon the man seeking for his throat, but being diverted by the long black beard this villager had grown, bit the man’s chest instead.

> Panthers being far smaller, shorter and weaker than tiger, are unable to carry away their kills clear of the ground. They have to drag their dead victims along, for which reason they do not go far before starting to eat.

> Tigers, which are not only taller but immeasurably stronger, are able to lift a victim as heavy as a buffalo clear of the ground.

> Man-eating panthers as a rule, being inherently cowardly, attack only under cover of darkness, unlike the man-eating tiger, which is braver and bolder and attacks at any time.

> This is understandable as man-eaters—both tigers and panthers—carry or drag their kills into sheltered, dense undergrowth in order that they may enjoy their meal undisturbed.

> Panthers have no sense of smell, so it would not be able to scent me while I tiptoed down the pathway. But they have acute hearing and it might hear me if I made the slightest sound.

> Time meant everything to me, but nothing to them. It is the one thing in India that has never been rationed; and never will be.

> I fired twice into its head. Then I leaped quickly aside, for one must never forget to spring aside after firing at a tiger at close quarters, as the odds are ninety-nine to one that it will rush straightforward, even if it must die the next instant. A dying tiger can in fact do you an awful lot of harm.

> After all, they are individuals just as we are; they differ among themselves just as we differ and they suffer from some at least of our faults. The commonest of these is greed.

> But you must remember that tigers and panthers cannot reason as human beings do. They are creatures of instinct, even if such instinct is often uncanny in its efficiency.

> The rain has a strange knack of getting inside anything.

> Ordinarily it would slink away, for tigers and elephants avoid one another as much a possible.
