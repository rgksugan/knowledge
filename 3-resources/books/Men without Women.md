# Men without Women
by [[Haruki Murakami]]

## Highlights
> She sounded like a staunch vegetarian who had just been asked if she ate lettuce.

> Words, they felt, could only cheapen the emotions they were feeling.

> Whether you want to or not. But the place you return to is always slightly different from the place you left. That’s the rule. It can never be exactly the same.

> But he doubted the dead could think or feel anything. In his opinion, that was one of the great things about dying.

> In addition, the two of them had one big thing in common: both were still in love with the same beautiful, dead woman.

> But the proposition that we can look into another person’s heart with perfect clarity strikes me as a fool’s game.

> “Tobacco’s a killer,” Kafuku said. “Being alive is a killer, if you think about it,” Misaki said.

> But the self that one returned to was never exactly the same as the self that one had left behind.

> Because, in the final analysis, the language we speak constitutes who we are as people.

> She was as attractive as in her photograph, but when I saw her in the flesh what really drew me was less her looks than the kind of effortless vitality that seemed to radiate from her.

> Music has that power to revive memories, sometimes so intensely that they hurt.

> For Tokai, having dinner with these women, drinking wine with them, and talking together was a distinct pleasure. Sex was merely an added pleasure, but never the ultimate goal. What he sought most was an intimate, intellectual connection with a number of attractive women. What came after that just happened. Because of this, women found themselves naturally attracted to him, enjoyed spending time with him, and often took the initiative. Personally, I think most women in the world (particularly the really attractive ones) are fed up with men who are always panting to get them into bed.

> No operation could ever improve a woman’s intellectual skills.

> Having a pleasant conversation over dinner with an intelligent woman, or lingering over small talk while holding one another in bed—these were the moments he treasured.

> A gentleman doesn’t talk much about the taxes he paid, or the women he sleeps with.

> He felt that having several girlfriends was only natural, and never saw it as an act of infidelity.

> He was a cautious, careful person and he warned his girlfriends to be equally discrete. He issues three key pieces of advice: take your time and don’t force things; don’t fall into predictable patterns; and when you do have to lie, make sure to keep it simple.

> He may have felt that, like therapists and religious leaders, writers had a legitimate right (or duty) to hear people’s confessions.

> The deep sense of loss after you’ve met the woman you love, have made love, then said goodbye. Like you’re suffocating. The same emotion hasn’t changed at all in a thousand years. I’ve never had this feeling up till now, and it makes me realize how incomplete I’ve been, as a person.

> One huge problem is that the more I get to know her, the more I love her. We’ve gone out for a year and a half, but right now I’m even more entranced than I was at the beginning. It feels like our hearts have become intertwined. Like when she feels something, my heart moves in tandem. Like we’re two boats tied together with rope. Even if you want to cut the rope, there’s no knife sharp enough to do it. I’ve never experienced this—ever. And it scares me. If my feelings for her get even stronger, what in the world’s going to happen to me?

> Falling in love is like that. You can’t control your feelings, and it’s like some outrageous power is manipulating you. What you’re going through is nothing abnormal. You’ve just fallen deeply in love with a woman, and you don’t want to lose her. You want to keep on seeing her. If you can’t, then it feels like the end of the world. This is natural. Nothing strange or unusual about it.

> Women are all born with a special, independent organ that allows them to lie.

> No, her secret was too weighty and dark to reveal to anyone—she had to bear it alone.

> Her brain was powerless to persuade her heart.

> Life is strange, isn’t it? You can be totally entranced by the glow of something one minute, be willing to sacrifice everything to make it yours, but then a little time passes, or your perspective changes a bit, and all of a sudden you’re shocked at how faded it appears.

> The prospect of losing that made him saddest of all.

> Like dry ground welcoming the rain, he let the solitude, silence, and loneliness soak in.

> Brandy was a drink that went well with silence—you gently swirled it, appreciated the color, inhaled the fragrance.

> Her body was no longer his, though. No longer could he see it, let alone touch it. All he could do was imagine it.

> Maybe working on the little things as dutifully and honestly as we can is how we stay sane when the world is falling apart.

> If you think of someone enough, you’re sure to meet them again.

> The kind of unsettled feeling the newly deceased bring on is highly contagious.

> It’s quite easy to become Men Without Women. You love a woman deeply, and then she goes off somewhere. That’s all it takes. Most of the time (as I’m sure you’re well aware) it’s crafty sailors who take them away.
