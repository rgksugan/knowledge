# Domain-Driven Design
by [[Eric Evans]]

## Highlights
> Every software program relates to some activity or interest of its user. That subject area to which the user applies the program is the domain of the software. Some domains involve the physical world: The domain of an airline-booking program involves real people getting on real aircraft. Some domains are intangible: The domain of an accounting program is money and finance. Software domains usually have little to do with computers, though there are exceptions: The domain of a source-code control system is software development itself.

> A model is a simplification. It is an interpretation of reality that abstracts the aspects relevant to solving the problem at hand and ignores extraneous detail.

> A model is a selectively simplified and consciously structured form of knowledge.

> A domain model is not a particular diagram; it is the idea that the diagram is intended to convey.
