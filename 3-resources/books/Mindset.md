# Mindset
by [[Carol S. Dweck]]

## Highlights
> Next time you’re tempted to surround yourself with worshipers, go to church. In the rest of your life, seek constructive criticism.

> One of the key things that the successful businessperson must be good at is negotiation.

> A no-effort relationship is a doomed relationship, not a great relationship.

> A good teacher is one who continues to learn along with the students.

> Success is about being your best self, not about being better than others; failure is an opportunity, not a condemnation; effort is the key to success.

> Next time you’re tempted to surround yourself with worshipers, go to church. In the rest of your life, seek constructive criticism.

> Just because some people can do something with little or no training, it doesn’t mean that others can’t do it (and sometimes do it even better) with training.

> I controlled half of the relationship, my half. I could have my half of the relationship. At least I could be the loving daughter I wanted to be. In a sense, it didn’t matter what she did. I would still be ahead of where I was.

> Every day he tells his students that he is no smarter than they are—just more experienced.

> There is a strong message in our society about how to boost children’s self-esteem, and a main part of that message is: Protect them from failure! While this may help with the immediate problem of a child’s disappointment, it can be harmful in the long run.

> All of his fifth graders master a reading list that includes Of Mice and Men, Native Son, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, The Joy Luck Club, The Diary of Anne Frank, To Kill a Mockingbird, and A Separate Peace.

> Rather than praising her intelligence or her grade, I asked questions that made her reflect on the effort she put into studying and on how she has improved from the year before.

> If parents want to give their children a gift, the best thing they can do is to teach their children to love challenges, be intrigued by mistakes, enjoy effort, seek new strategies, and keep on learning.

> So telling children they’re smart, in the end, made them feel dumber and act dumber, but claim they were smarter. I don’t think this is what we’re aiming for when we put positive labels—“gifted,” “talented,” “brilliant”—on people. We don’t mean to rob them of their zest for challenge and their recipes for success. But that’s the danger.

> Even in the growth mindset, failure can be a painful experience. But it doesn’t define you. It’s a problem to be faced, dealt with, and learned from.

> People in a growth mindset don’t just seek challenge, they thrive on it. The bigger the challenge, the more they stretch.

> The other thing exceptional people seem to have is a special talent for converting life’s setbacks into future successes.

> The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when it’s not going well, is the hallmark of the growth mindset. This is the mindset that allows people to thrive during some of the most challenging times in their lives.

> This growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts, your strategies, and help from others. Although people may differ in every which way—in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments—everyone can change and grow through application and experience.
