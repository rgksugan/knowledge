# The Stranger
by [[Albert Camus]]

## Highlights
> In his opinion every man on the earth was under sentence of death.

> People were starting on a voyage to a world which had ceased to concern me forever.

> I said I saw no point in troubling my head about the matter; whether I believed or didn’t was, to my mind, a question of so little importance.

> It makes little difference whether one dies at the age of thirty or threescore and ten—since, in either case, other men and women will continue living, the world will go on as before.

> Mother used to say that however miserable one is, there’s always something to be thankful for.

> One always has exaggerated ideas about what one doesn’t know.

> Now I had to admit it seemed a very simple process, getting guillotined; the machine is on the same level as the man, and he walks toward it as he steps forward to meet somebody he knows. In a sense, that, too, was disappointing.

> I’ve often thought that had I been compelled to live in the trunk of a dead tree, with nothing to do but gaze up at the patch of sky just overhead, I’d have got used to it by degrees.

> I remembered it had been one of Mother’s pet ideas—she was always voicing it—that in the long run one gets used to anything.

> I was obsessed by thoughts of this woman or that, of all the ones I’d had, all the circumstances under which I’d loved them; so much so that the cell grew crowded with their faces, ghosts of my old passions.

> It passed my understanding why I shouldn’t be allowed even to smoke; it could have done no one any harm. Later on, I understood the idea behind it; this privation, too, was part of my punishment. But, by the time I understood, I’d lost the craving, so it had ceased to be a punishment.

> For the first time I’d realized how all these people loathed me.

> I noticed that he laid stress on my “intelligence.” It puzzled me rather why what would count as a good point in an ordinary person should be used against an accused man as an overwhelming proof of his guilt.

> The futility of what was happening here seemed to take me by the throat, I felt like vomiting, and I had only one idea: to get it over, to go back to my cell, and sleep ... and sleep.

> Often and often I blame myself for not having given more attention to accounts of public executions. One should always take an interest in such matters.

> Yet I could but recognize that, from the moment the verdict was given, its effects became as cogent, as tangible, as, for example, this wall against which I was lying, pressing my back to it.
