# Zikora
by [[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]]

## Highlights
> “I think I should leave. Is that okay?” he asked as though he needed my permission to abandon me. He would kill you, but he would do it courteously.

> I read somewhere that love was about this, the nuggets of knowledge about our beloved that we so fluently hold.

> If he was going to have a child, of course he should have a say, but how much of a say, since the body was mine, since in creating a child, Nature demanded so much of the woman and so little of the man.

> Men know very little about women’s bodies.

> How you imagine something will be is always worse than how it actually ends up being.

> Some kindnesses you do not ever forget. You carry them to your grave, held warmly somewhere, brought up and savored from time to time.
