# Diagnosis
by [[Lisa Sanders]]

## Highlights
> A truism in medicine is that when we hear hoof beats we should think of ordinary horses as the cause rather than the rare zebra.

> In medicine, it is essential to rule out diseases that can kill, and then move on to those that may only make you wish you were dead.

> Our lives depend on our ability to form blood clots. But like so much in the body, context is everything. In the right place, at the right time, a blood clot can save your life by preventing uncontrolled bleeding. In another setting, that same clot can kill. Clots normally form at the site of injury to a blood vessel. They can also form when blood stops moving; that’s why anything that causes prolonged immobility, like traveling or being stuck in bed, increases the risk of a clot. Certain drugs—estrogen and other steroid hormones—can also increase the risk. Some people have a genetic abnormality that makes their blood coagulate too readily. Finding the cause of a clot is crucial to estimating the risk of another.

> This and other physical-exam techniques are part of a disappearing tradition in medicine—replaced more or (in this case) less successfully with a variety of high-tech imaging techniques.

> This was stress cardiomyopathy, also called “broken heart syndrome.” First described by the Japanese in 1990, this disease occurs when an emotional trauma causes the brain to release high doses of stress hormones. This hormonal blast paralyzes the muscle cells of the heart, preventing them from working to pump the blood.

> It is that some cancers—perhaps most of them—can trigger the body to release chemicals that signal the brain to develop depressive symptoms.
