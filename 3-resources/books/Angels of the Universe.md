# Angels of the Universe
by [[Einar Már Guðmundsson]]

## Highlights
> It is better to know little about the holy writings and live by them, than to know a lot about the holy writings but not live by them.

> The policy is to make psychiatric hospitals as much like households as possible, perhaps because households have become so much like psychiatric hospitals.

> Either you’re a Communist or an idiot.

> I still don’t know why I didn’t manage to keep a better footing on the slippery path called life, why some people go through it straight down the main road while others wander endlessly around dim alleyways.

> This wall can collapse, but the walls between me and the world will never collapse; they stand unbreachable and firm, even though no one can see them with the naked eye.

> But we who are committed to asylums and kept in institutions, we have no answers when our ideas are at odds with reality, because in our world other people are right and know the difference between right and wrong.

> I trace the interest in genealogy in Iceland to the lack of trees. Because of the sparsity of trees, people opt for family trees and find themselves forests among their forebears

> I expect I look the way Karl Marx would have done if he had known that Communism would collapse.

> And once, after Dagny and I had split up, after she had taken my heart and thrown it out into the traffic where the cars roar like the lions of Rome and I watched it crushed as the poets do in their verses and felt the blood spurting . . .

> I became repulsed by school, cursed it to damnation, that den of idiots that belonged to the realm of the devil and was nothing but mediocrity writ large.

> Then I would go to see Dagny, because I refused to accept her rejection of me and went on calling on her, much to her vexation, although sometimes we could be friends and talk about how painful it was to fall in love and break up.

> There was wild aggression in the way she moved. When her breathing filled the room I stood on the peak of the mountain where illumination awaited me.
