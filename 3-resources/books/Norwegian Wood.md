# Norwegian Wood
by [[Haruki Murakami]]

## Highlights
> If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking.

> It is not that I don't believe in contemporary literature, but I don't want to waste valuable time reading any book that has not had the baptism of time.

> What makes us most normal is knowing that we're not normal.
