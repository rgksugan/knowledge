# Atomic Habits
by [[James Clear]]

## Highlights
> Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.

> You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.

> Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.

> Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.

> Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.

> The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity.

> The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.

> True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity.

> The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it.

> Whatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because you have proof of it. If you go to church every Sunday for twenty years, you have evidence that you are religious. If you study biology for one hour every night, you have evidence that you are studious. If you go to the gym even when it’s snowing, you have evidence that you are committed to fitness. The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it.

> It is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins.
