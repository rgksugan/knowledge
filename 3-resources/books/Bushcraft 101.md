# Bushcraft 101
by [[Dave Canterbury]]

## Highlights
> Sleeping at least four solid hours per night is crucial to enjoying your time afoot.

> You can gauge someone’s experience level in the woods by how well he or she sleeps at night.

> Remember to always think outside the box about uses for the items you carry. In general, every item should have three uses, but the more you find, the fewer items you will add later.

> The triangle of death is the space between your upper legs, including the groin and both femoral arteries. Avoid this area with an exposed blade at all costs. Never cut into this area or hold objects to be cut or carved in a manner that could cause the blade to enter it.

> Remember that harder and green woods will burn longer, but softer deadwood will take flame faster, so a combination may be necessary for a good fire lay, depending on your conditions.

> Any stones used for cooking or placed directly within a fire should never come from creek beds or rivers. Even if they appear dry, they can still hold moisture that will cause a fracture when heated; they can create great danger from flying debris when they explode.

> Always pick fire locations carefully, bearing in mind the wind direction and strength so that the flames do not get out of hand.

> All fires need three components to burn: ignition (or heat), oxygen, and fuel. By understanding and controlling these inputs, you can master fire.

> If there is no sun, the trees will tell you the answer. All trees have one thing in common: They all have to effect photosynthesis to live, so the most branches will be on the side of the tree facing in a southern direction. Look at several trees to verify your conclusions.

> The most important reason to carry a compass is so that we can walk a straight line over distance. Everyone experiences what is called lateral drift, which causes us to gradually move left or right over long distances when walking. If you can see an object, you can easily walk straight toward it. However, if you go down a hill or an obstruction blocks your view of your intended destination, you will no longer walk the same straight line. This is why you carry a compass.

> It is prudent to set camp at least two hours before sunset in the summer and four hours in the winter, because of supplies needed for a comfortable night, such as wood.

> Animals will notice things that change on their daily routes, just as you would if someone moved something or placed something new in your living room. The animals come to investigate and leave tracks, enabling to you to identify what types of animals frequent the area.

> A cashew nut may be new to squirrels, and the sweet aroma will definitely attract them. For other animals that are scavengers, such as raccoons or opossum, any stinky thing such as frog entrails or half of a bluegill will work well. The key element to good bait is finding something the animal wants that is not common to the area. If acorns are lying all over the ground, what is the chance a squirrel will pick the one that baits your tap? However, a lone walnut, broken to release the scent into the air, may be just the right ticket to attract the squirrel’s attention. Birds like small fruit, so if you have to travel a bit to collect a few berries in an area where you know they are feeding on seed, you should do it!

> Don’t wait until you are hungry to secure food; this will only make things worse and lessen the chance for success.

> Check the organs of any kill to ensure that they look healthy: brightly colored with no blotching or worms.

> Again, livers and hearts make great food, and all birds are edible. However, with scavenger birds such as buzzards, you should boil the meat well to ensure that any parasites are killed prior to consumption. Use your best judgment when examining the meat and organs for overall health.
