# Engineering Management for the Rest of Us
by [[Sarah Drasner]]

## Highlights
> Leadership is challenging: where your work used to be about you and what value you brought to a team, your work is now about enabling everyone around you.

> The fact that you’re worried that you’re not a good manager is a key part of being a good manager.

> People are not pure functions; they have all sorts of interesting side effects.

> Values are the fundamental beliefs that guide us, motivate us, and drive our actions.

> If you pay attention, you can see how a person’s values dictate their behavior and ethics.

> Values don’t offer something to fix, or an action to take; they provide us context so that we can be more understanding of what is happening and why.

> More often, conflicts are the result of a misalignment of values, and neither person is attempting malice against the other. If their needs aren’t met and they aren’t communicating in a way that someone else with dissimilar values can understand, that may be detrimental to their relationship. Doing work to understand values as a team can help members see one another as people, and understand where they are coming from. The act of sharing values can also have a side effect of building trust and vulnerability on a team.

> All criticism, attack, insults, and judgments vanish when we focus attention on hearing the feelings and needs behind a message.

> When people talk about “good” managers, they are likely referring to people who show care and appreciation for people’s values, and also respect their boundaries.

> Trust is built in drops and lost in buckets.

> We are by nature more drawn to people with whom we share similarities.

> I frequently try to remind myself that everyone I meet has something they know well, and that I would be lucky to learn from them. Every person has a wealth of experience and knowledge. I am grateful that in the time I spend with them, I can learn and grow a bit more. Learning is one of my values.

> The leadership team is also a team, and should also be treated as your team. How you speak about this team is equally important.

> Saying “we” holds you accountable to your team for leadership decisions that you are a part of, which is how it should be.
