# Engineering Management for the Rest of Us
by [[Sarah Drasner]]

## Highlights
> Leadership is challenging: where your work used to be about you and what value you brought to a team, your work is now about enabling everyone around you.

> The fact that you’re worried that you’re not a good manager is a key part of being a good manager.

> People are not pure functions; they have all sorts of interesting side effects.

> Values are the fundamental beliefs that guide us, motivate us, and drive our actions.

> If you pay attention, you can see how a person’s values dictate their behavior and ethics.

> Values don’t offer something to fix, or an action to take; they provide us context so that we can be more understanding of what is happening and why.

> More often, conflicts are the result of a misalignment of values, and neither person is attempting malice against the other. If their needs aren’t met and they aren’t communicating in a way that someone else with dissimilar values can understand, that may be detrimental to their relationship. Doing work to understand values as a team can help members see one another as people, and understand where they are coming from. The act of sharing values can also have a side effect of building trust and vulnerability on a team.

> All criticism, attack, insults, and judgments vanish when we focus attention on hearing the feelings and needs behind a message.

> When people talk about “good” managers, they are likely referring to people who show care and appreciation for people’s values, and also respect their boundaries.

> Trust is built in drops and lost in buckets.

> We are by nature more drawn to people with whom we share similarities.

> I frequently try to remind myself that everyone I meet has something they know well, and that I would be lucky to learn from them. Every person has a wealth of experience and knowledge. I am grateful that in the time I spend with them, I can learn and grow a bit more. Learning is one of my values.

> The leadership team is also a team, and should also be treated as your team. How you speak about this team is equally important.

> Saying “we” holds you accountable to your team for leadership decisions that you are a part of, which is how it should be.

> In an industry that moves as quickly as technology, you have more to lose by staying still.

> Praise in public, feedback in private.

> We work best together when we’re all learning from one another.

> The best way to have a productive disagreement is to disengage from any kind of personal attachment to an idea from the get-go.

> Intrinsic rewards come when you do something for the sake of doing it, and extrinsic rewards come when you complete a task to get outside validation. The book Drive isolates each type of reward and shows how those motivated by intrinsic working habits and desires are more productive over the long haul.

> Our brains have a negative bias. This seems like a bad thing, but negative bias is actually a very strong, protective evolutionary mechanism. You burn your hand on the stove, your brain forces that memory on you so that you know not to do that again. Given two different memories (a bad one and a good one) your brain will remind you of the bad memory more often, when left to its own devices. When you feel fear from something, like when your brain remembers that burn, you try to avoid that danger in the future.

> Like it or not, when you enter leadership roles, your words have weight. Something that has seemed like harmless venting in the past now has the potential to create large rifts in your organization.

> Ask for feedback in a 1:1. You can do this a few different ways, but it is a good idea to let people know ahead of time that you will be asking for feedback so that you don’t throw them off guard. Power dynamics can make it tough for people to assess what they’re comfortable sharing on the spot.

> There are several project management framework systems of ownership you can explore, such as DACI (driver, improver, contributor, and informed), which separates out each stakeholder so that everyone knows their role. There are several others, such as RACI (responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed) and RAPID (recommend, agree, perform, input, decide). Use whichever system makes the most sense for your organization.

> “Measure What Matters” suggests the 70 percent rule: be comfortable with only succeeding 70 percent of the time.

> It’s not enough for us to go fast. You can run fast in the wrong direction.

> If we constantly work on tasks without taking the time to think bigger, we risk being tactical rather than strategic.

> Celebrating what you’ve accomplished as a team costs very little and has great cultural benefits.

> If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.

> Tetris Effect. That is, if you start thinking about something a lot, you begin to notice it everywhere. And applying that to a gratitude practice can allow you to see what you might be grateful for that you could otherwise miss in the day-to-day.

> You may have heard of growth and fixed mindset: people with a fixed mindset tend to believe that their skills are immutable, and they can only be so good at something. On the other hand, someone with a growth mindset understands that, with effort, we can change.
