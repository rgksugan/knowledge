# The Remarkable Life of the Skin
by [[Monty Lyman]]

## Highlights
> When burns victims lose the majority of their skin surface, they require enormous amounts of fluids (sometimes more than 20 litres a day) to stay alive. Without our envelope of skin, we would evaporate.

> Although an individual human sheds more than a million skin cells each day, making up roughly half the dust found in our homes, our entire epidermis is completely replaced each month.

> Callus formation – hyperkeratosis – is a healthy, protective response from our skin when it needs to reinforce the wall.

> This helps explain why eczema worsens in the cold of winter, with researchers advising extra protection with emollients over this period for those at risk.

> If we eat late at night, our skin’s clock assumes that it must be dinner time and consequently pushes back the activation of the morning-UV-protection genes, leaving us more exposed the next day. So while studies are increasingly showing that a lack of sleep is detrimental to our overall physical and mental health, it now seems that our skin also benefits from additional sleep. The epidermis may be built to face the outside world, but it’s increasingly clear that it also looks inwards, even at when we choose to eat.

> No matter what the outside temperature, our body needs to tread an inner tightrope between 36°C and 38°C, and anything much above 42°C is lethal.

> Our skin carries four million of these glands, and together they are capable of pumping out literally bucket-loads of sweat each day, with some humans capable of sweating three litres an hour.

> On a hot day, the brain’s sensitive hypothalamus detects a rise in the body’s core temperature and fires signals along autonomic (unconsciously acting) nerves to the eccrine glands, instructing them to send sweat to the skin’s surface.

> When sweat – essentially water with a few trace particles of salts – lies exposed on naked skin, it rapidly evaporates. The process of evaporation removes high-energy, heat-containing molecules from the body, immediately cooling the skin and the blood vessels of the dermis. The cooled venous blood then returns from the skin to the core of the body, preventing a dangerous rise in our core temperature.

> We have eccrine sweat glands all over our skin, but their density is greatest on our palms and soles. However, these areas do not seem to produce a larger volume of sweat in response to heat and exercise; instead, the glands on our hands and feet respond keenly to another stimulant of our autonomic nerves: stress. This explains why we get clammy hands as we wait outside an interview room, no matter what the temperature. Perhaps surprisingly, the sweat on our palms and soles actually increases friction and grip on the skin’s surface, as our body readies itself for grappling with an enemy or fleeing up a tree. Sweat is also defensive.

> But sweat is just one component of the skin’s thermostat. Blood vessels in the dermis, also stimulated by the nerves, either dilate to help the body lose heat or constrict to keep it in.

> Conversely, when we need to stay warm we might not have a thick layer of fur, but our hair follicles temporarily toil together to form another covering.

> The hair shafts on our skin usually lie flat, but when it’s cold the arrector pili muscle attached to each hair follicle in the dermis contracts. This contraction makes the hairs erect, trapping a thin layer of warmer air above the skin and creating a temporary coat.

> A prolonged sniff of your loved one will trigger happy memories and reduce stress levels.

> Evidence suggests that the smell of sweat could play a role in our sexual preparedness.

> Preferring a partner with dissimilar genes obviously makes sense from an incest-avoiding perspective, but studies also show that the offspring of partners with more dissimilar MHC genes have a more varied, and often stronger, immune system than children of partners with more similar MHC genes.

> The acids in sebum also keep the surface of the skin slightly acidic (between a pH of 4.5 and 6), which deters potentially dangerous bacteria, while those that adapt to this environment will be consequently less able to thrive if they manage to get past the skin and infect the alkaline environment of the blood.

> While nerves stimulate the wellsprings of our sweat glands, sex hormones have the greatest effect on sebaceous glands. This can become a problem when the pubertal rise in testosterone fuels excess sebum production, contributing to acne.

> Nine out of ten cases of high blood pressure in humans have no known cause, but some of the answers may well lie in our skin.

> Also, it is much harder to get blisters in these ridged areas,

> What we do know is that no matter how much our fingers grow, our fingerprints remain unchanged from cradle to grave.

> The hypodermis is also highly vascularized, making it an ideal target for injecting a payload of medication, such as insulin.
