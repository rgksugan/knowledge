# The Remarkable Life of the Skin
by [[Monty Lyman]]

## Highlights
> When burns victims lose the majority of their skin surface, they require enormous amounts of fluids (sometimes more than 20 litres a day) to stay alive. Without our envelope of skin, we would evaporate.

> Although an individual human sheds more than a million skin cells each day, making up roughly half the dust found in our homes, our entire epidermis is completely replaced each month.

> If we eat late at night, our skin’s clock assumes that it must be dinner time and consequently pushes back the activation of the morning-UV-protection genes, leaving us more exposed the next day. So while studies are increasingly showing that a lack of sleep is detrimental to our overall physical and mental health, it now seems that our skin also benefits from additional sleep. The epidermis may be built to face the outside world, but it’s increasingly clear that it also looks inwards, even at when we choose to eat.

> A prolonged sniff of your loved one will trigger happy memories and reduce stress levels.

> Evidence suggests that the smell of sweat could play a role in our sexual preparedness.

> Preferring a partner with dissimilar genes obviously makes sense from an incest-avoiding perspective, but studies also show that the offspring of partners with more dissimilar MHC genes have a more varied, and often stronger, immune system than children of partners with more similar MHC genes.

> What we do know is that no matter how much our fingers grow, our fingerprints remain unchanged from cradle to grave.

> Cooking and food processing often increase the glycaemic index of food.

> In the same way that Earth has radically varied ecosystems and habitats, including oceans, deserts and rainforests, human skin has a number of habitats that support completely different populations of flora and fauna.

> Vaginal microbes contain more ‘good’ bacteria than the mother’s abdominal skin and those of the hospital environment, which has more of the pesky S. aureus, and this may be why C-section babies appear to have an increased risk of developing allergies later on in life.

> Even when weight, age and sex are accounted for, the incidence of acne is greater among those with higher intakes of high-glycaemic-index foods.

> It is certainly worth eating lots of fruit and vegetables, but it is not worth pursuing one particular ‘superfood’.

> Produced in the skin in response to ultraviolet rays from the sun, vitamin D has direct effects on mineral absorption in the gut.

> You are what you eat, depending on who you are.

> It is clear, then, that diet does affect skin, but that it’s not as straightforward as we’d like it to be.

> Dehydration makes the skin lose its turgor (its elasticity) and shape because skin cells lose a lot of their volume. We can be certain that a lack of water is bad for our skin, but that doesn’t mean that drinking above-average levels is particularly good for it. It’s safe to say that drinking recommended daily amounts of water is healthy: roughly 2.5 litres a day for men and 2 litres for women (of which 70–80 per cent comes from drinks and the rest from food).

> When it comes to the appearance and health of our skin, alcohol is almost always detrimental. In the short term it dehydrates the skin, giving it a sallow, puffy appearance, and the sugar that saturates most cocktails also aggravates acne and may even hasten wrinkles.

> When alcohol is metabolized it is partly excreted in our sweat, and this process has been impressively exploited by recent ‘transdermal alcohol technology’, where a bracelet can now continuously and accurately measure the level of alcohol in our system through the skin. It is not inconceivable that one day we will be adding our blood alcohol content to the wealth of personal data we sell to smart technology.

> Collagen is commonly included in skin creams but the molecule is too big to penetrate our skin from the outside, so any effects are likely to be due to the cream’s short-term moisturising qualities rather than the effect of the collagen itself.

> When people lie in the sun believing that they are protected from cancer by a vitamin drink, pseudo-science moves from the realms of comedy to potential tragedy.

> The skin and the gut talk to each other through diet and metabolism, but they also use another means of communication, which is sometimes dramatic and always intriguing: the immune system. If someone has an allergic response to food, often the first signs show up on the skin, whether it’s a red rash, hives or swollen lips.

> Pseudoallergy, a skin reaction or intolerance resembling allergy but where IgE is not produced, is harder to diagnose.

> While in an allergy an IgE antibody responds to common food allergens such as milk, eggs and shellfish, in coeliac disease a form of antibody called IgA – which protects the gut and mucous membranes from foreign invaders – reacts against gliadin (amongst other molecules), a protein found in gluten.

> The sun harms, but it also heals.

> Both cats and dogs secrete cholesterol-containing oils from their skin on to their hairs. When exposed to sunlight, the cholesterol compounds in the oil are converted to vitamin D. But it can now only enter the animal’s body orally, and so this is one of the reasons for your pet’s constant hair-licking.

> It is well established that the detection of light by human eyes influences circadian rhythms and their metabolic effects on the body, such as increasing the release of the hormone cortisol in the morning to boost blood glucose levels. But it could be that our skin also influences our seasonal rhythms.

> The colours, freckles and spots of our skin tell a story, and it’s one that we should read regularly.

> Sun exposure damages both our health and our looks; it is actually a more significant cause of accelerated skin ageing than all other causes combined. Most importantly, however, it is the greatest risk factor for a group of diseases that is causing suffering and death at epidemic levels in many parts of the world: skin cancer.

> People with albinism – who have a genetic absence of melanin – are subject to all forms of skin cancer from an early age, and without lifelong sun protection as well as meticulous attention and treatment, their lives are cut tragically short.

> UVA is also able to penetrate glass, while UVB cannot, so while you’re unlikely to get sunburn through a window, the skin-ageing effect continues as long as you are exposed to sunlight.

> Sunlight is certainly the greatest contributor to skin-ageing, probably more than all other factors combined, including time itself. The key to youthful skin is sun protection, and the most effective anti-ageing cream is sunscreen.

> Alongside sun damage, smoking is an incredibly powerful accelerator of skin-ageing.

> Inadequate sleep harms our immunological, metabolic and mental health, which inevitably accelerates skin-ageing.

> The concentration of nerve endings in a given area of skin affects the accuracy of sensation.

> When it comes to their distribution, our whole body is a unique fingerprint: areas that are highly sensitive and bring great pleasure in some people barely raise an eyebrow in others. Why this variation exists is still unknown, and it may be a long time before we discover this secret of the sexual skin.

> Pain, although unpleasant, is a vital warning sign of tissue damage and we cannot live without it.

> Physical stimulation of non-pain receptors (such as receptors that detect vibration) can actually reduce pain. This is why rubbing the skin over a freshly knocked knee can dampen down the pain, at least temporarily.

> In the many conversations I’ve had with soldiers in one of the world’s leading military hospitals in Birmingham, they report that even the most devastating injuries can feel painless in the heat of battle.

> It is a curious fact that feelings of pleasure are only fleeting, yet too often pain persists.

> The mind affects the skin, but the skin also directly affects the mind.

> In many ways, acne is more of a psychological disease than a physical one.

## Contents
* No matter what the outside temperature, our body needs to tread an inner tightrope between 36°C and 38°C, and anything much above 42°C is lethal. Our skin carries four million of these glands, and together they are capable of pumping out literally bucket-loads of sweat each day, with some humans capable of sweating three litres an hour. On a hot day, the brain’s sensitive hypothalamus detects a rise in the body’s core temperature and fires signals along autonomic (unconsciously acting) nerves to the eccrine glands, instructing them to send sweat to the skin’s surface. When sweat – essentially water with a few trace particles of salts – lies exposed on naked skin, it rapidly evaporates. The process of evaporation removes high-energy, heat-containing molecules from the body, immediately cooling the skin and the blood vessels of the dermis. The cooled venous blood then returns from the skin to the core of the body, preventing a dangerous rise in our core temperature. But sweat is just one component of the skin’s thermostat. Blood vessels in the dermis, also stimulated by the nerves, either dilate to help the body lose heat or constrict to keep it in. The hair shafts on our skin usually lie flat, but when it’s cold the arrector pili muscle attached to each hair follicle in the dermis contracts. This contraction makes the hairs erect, trapping a thin layer of warmer air above the skin and creating a temporary coat.
