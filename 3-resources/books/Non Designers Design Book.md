# Non Designers Design Book
by [[Williams Robin]]

## Highlights
> Get in the habit of drawing lines between elements to determine where the connections are lacking.

> A centered alignment often appears a bit weak. If text is aligned, instead, on the left or the right, the invisible line that connects the text is much stronger because it has a hard vertical edge to follow. This gives left- and right-aligned text a cleaner and more dramatic look.

> There are six clear and distinct ways to contrast type: size, weight, structure, form, direction, and color.

> Contrast not only serves to draw in the eye, but you can use it to organize information, clarify the hierarchy, guide a reader around the page, and provide a focus.

> Find a strong line and use it.

> Items relating to each other should be grouped close together. When several items are in close proximity to each other, they become one visual unit rather than several separate units. This helps organize information, reduces clutter, and gives the reader a clear structure.

> Every element should have some visual connection with another element on the page. This creates a clean and sophisticated look.

> Repeat visual elements of the design throughout the piece. You can repeat colors, shapes, textures, spatial relationships, line thicknesses, fonts, sizes, graphic concepts, etc. This develops the organization and strengthens the unity.

> Never center headlines over flush left body copy or text that has an indent because if the text does not have clear left and right edges, you cannot tell that the headline is actually centered. It looks random.

> Use CMYK for projects that are to be printed. Use RGB for anything that will be viewed on a screen.

> Contrast not only serves to draw in the eye, but you can use it to organize information, clarify the hierarchy, guide a reader around the page, and provide a focus.

> Contrast is one of the most effective ways to add visual interest to your page and to create an organizational hierarchy among different elements.

> The Principle of Contrast states: Contrast various elements of the piece to draw a reader’s eye into the page. If two items are not exactly the same, then make them different. Really different.

> The Principle of Repetition states: Repeat some aspect of the design throughout the entire piece. The repetitive element may be a bold font, a thick rule (line), a certain bullet, design element, color, format, spatial relationships, etc. It can be anything that a reader will visually recognize.

> The Principle of Alignment states: Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Every item should have a visual connection with something else on the page. The principle of alignment forces you to be conscious—no longer can you just throw things on the page and see where they stick.

> The Principle of Proximity states: Group related items together. Move them physically close to each other so the related items are seen as one cohesive group rather than a bunch of unrelated bits.

> Squint your eyes slightly and count the number of visual elements on the page by counting the number of times your eye stops. If there are more than three to five items on the page (of course it depends on the piece), see which of the separate elements can be grouped together into closer proximity to become one visual unit.

> When several items are in close proximity to each other, they become one visual unit rather than several separate units. Items relating to each other should be grouped together. Be conscious of where your eye is going: Where do you start looking; what path do you follow; where do you end up; after you’ve read it, where does your eye go next? You should be able to follow a logical progression through the piece, from a definite beginning to a definite end.

> When several items are in close proximity to each other, they become one visual unit rather than several separate units. As in Life, the proximity, or the closeness, implies a relationship.

> Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Every element should have some visual connection with another element on the page.

> Train your eyes to notice the invisible lines.
